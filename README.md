# xcancel Slack bot

When visiting an X link, you cannot see the replies to the post unless you have an account. Alternatively, there is xcancel: replace `x.com` with `xcancel.com` and you will see the original post and all its replies anonymously.

From now on, when you post an X link, `@X to xcancel` will also post the xcancel link to offer you a privacy-friendly alternative.
